## Aim
This lab is meant to get students more accustomed to the technologies used in designing and implementing a RESTful API server.
## Requirements
The task design a RESTful API that allows each IoT enabled water tank to interface with your server so that the measure values can be represented visually on a web page. The web page will be designed by another member of your team.

The API should also support the maintenance of a simple user profile.

The server should be able to perform the actions of a simple HTTP web server. The server should be able to perform actions on a resource such as Create, Read, Update and Delete.
